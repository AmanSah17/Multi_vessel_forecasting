# 🚀 Advanced Improvements Guide - LSTM vs Temporal CNN

## 📋 Overview

This guide covers the advanced improvements to address LSTM underfitting and introduces Temporal CNN for comparison.

---

## 🔍 Underfitting Analysis

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Insufficient Model Capacity** - 2 LSTM layers may be too small
2. **Limited Features** - Only 12 basic features
3. **Short Sequences** - 30 timesteps may miss long-term patterns
4. **Aggressive Regularization** - Dropout 0.3 may be too high
5. **Early Stopping** - May stop too early

### Solutions Implemented
✅ Increased hidden units: 128 → 256
✅ Increased LSTM layers: 2 → 3
✅ Increased sequence length: 30 → 60
✅ Reduced dropout: 0.3 → 0.2
✅ Added advanced features: 12 → 50+

## 🛠️ Advanced Feature Engineering

### 1. Lag Features (Temporal Dependencies)
```python
# Previous timestep values
LAT_lag1, LAT_lag2, LAT_lag3
LON_lag1, LON_lag2, LON_lag3
SOG_lag1, SOG_lag2, SOG_lag3
```
**Benefit**: Captures short-term temporal patterns

### 2. Rolling Statistics (Trend & Volatility)
```python
# Rolling mean (trend)
SOG_rolling_mean_3, SOG_rolling_mean_5

# Rolling std (volatility)
COG_rolling_std_3, COG_rolling_std_5
```
**Benefit**: Captures trend and volatility

### 3. Acceleration Features
```python
speed_acceleration = diff(speed_change)
heading_acceleration = diff(heading_change)
```
**Benefit**: Captures acceleration patterns

### 4. Cyclical Encoding
```python
hour_sin = sin(2π * hour / 24)
hour_cos = cos(2π * hour / 24)
dow_sin = sin(2π * day_of_week / 7)
dow_cos = cos(2π * day_of_week / 7)
```
**Benefit**: Better representation of circular features

### 5. Velocity Components
```python
velocity_x = SOG * cos(COG)
velocity_y = SOG * sin(COG)
```
**Benefit**: Better movement representation

### 6. Polynomial Features
```python
LAT_squared = LAT²
LON_squared = LON²
SOG_squared = SOG²
```
**Benefit**: Captures non-linear patterns

| Parameter | Before | After | Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| hidden_size | 128 | 256 | +100% capacity |
| num_layers | 2 | 3 | Better feature extraction |
| dropout | 0.3 | 0.2 | Less regularization |

## 🧠 Temporal CNN Model

### Architecture
```
Input (batch, 60, 50)
  ↓
Conv1d Projection (50 → 64 filters)
  ↓
Dilated Conv Blocks (4 layers)
  - Dilation: 1, 2, 4, 8
  - Batch Normalization
  - ReLU Activation
  - Dropout
  ↓
Global Average Pooling
  ↓
FC Layers (64 → 128 → 64 → 4)
  ↓
Output (batch, 4)
```

### Advantages over LSTM
✅ **Faster Training** - Parallelizable convolutions
✅ **Multi-scale Patterns** - Dilated convolutions
✅ **Fewer Parameters** - More efficient
✅ **Better Gradient Flow** - Residual connections
✅ **Batch Normalization** - Training stability

### Disadvantages
⚠️ **Limited Long-term Dependencies** - Fixed receptive field
⚠️ **Less Interpretable** - Black box
⚠️ **Requires More Features** - Needs feature engineering
