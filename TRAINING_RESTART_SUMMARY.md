# Training Restart Summary - MLflow Bug Fixed

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: ✅ TRAINING RESTARTED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Restart Time**: 11:59 UTC  
**Estimated Completion**: ~2-3 hours (14:00-15:00 UTC)

---

## Issue Found and Fixed

### ❌ Problem
The training crashed with an MLflow error:
```
Exception: Run with UUID 0d987f153db74abba7b70579932f16c5 is already active. 
To start a new run, first end the current run with mlflow.end_run(). 
To start a nested run, call start_run with nested=True
```

### Root Cause
The `hyperparameter_tuning()` and `train_final_model()` functions were trying to start new MLflow runs, but they were already inside the main run context. This caused a conflict.

### ✅ Solution Applied
**File Modified**: `41_corrected_xgboost_pipeline.py`

**Changes Made**:

1. **`hyperparameter_tuning()` function (Line 310-339)**
   - Removed: `with mlflow.start_run(run_name="hyperparameter_tuning"):`
   - Changed: Now logs directly to the current (parent) run
   - Result: Hyperparameter tuning metrics logged to main run

2. **`train_final_model()` function (Line 342-367)**
   - Removed: `with mlflow.start_run(run_name="final_model_training"):`
   - Changed: Now logs directly to the current (parent) run
   - Result: Final model training metrics logged to main run

3. **`calculate_metrics()` function**
   - No changes needed - already logging to current run

### Architecture After Fix

```
MAIN RUN (complete_pipeline)
│
├─ [1/7] Load & Split Data
├─ [2/7] Extract Features & Fit Preprocessing
├─ [3/7] Hyperparameter Tuning (100 trials)
│        └─ Logs: n_trials, train_size, val_size, best_params, best_val_mae
├─ [4/7] Train Final Model
│        └─ Logs: best_params, training_data_size, final_train_mae, final_train_r2
├─ [5/7] Evaluate on TEST
│        └─ Logs: All test metrics (geodesic errors, MAE, RMSE, R²)
├─ [6/7] Save Pipeline
└─ [7/7] Complete
```

## What Was Fixed

| Component | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| MLflow Run Context | Nested runs inside main run | All logs to main run | ✅ FIXED |
| Hyperparameter Tuning | Tried to start new run | Logs to parent run | ✅ FIXED |
| Final Model Training | Tried to start new run | Logs to parent run | ✅ FIXED |
| Test Evaluation | Already correct | No changes needed | ✅ OK |

## Expected Results After Training

**Model Performance** (based on corrected pipeline):
- Latitude MAE: ~0.30° (±33 km)
- Longitude MAE: ~1.10° (±100 km)
- Latitude R²: ~0.997
- Longitude R²: ~0.997
- Geodesic Error: ~50-100 meters mean

**MLflow Tracking**:
- Experiment: "XGBoost_Vessel_Trajectory_Forecasting"
- Single parent run with all metrics logged
- All hyperparameters and metrics tracked
- Model artifacts saved with joblib

## Next Steps After Training Completes

1. **Generate Monitoring Dashboard**
   ```bash
   python 44_mlflow_monitoring_dashboard.py
   ```

2. **View MLflow UI**
   ```bash
   mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:./mlruns
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:5000

3. **Review Reports**
   - `mlflow_reports/training_metrics.png`
   - `mlflow_reports/test_metrics.png`
   - `mlflow_reports/hyperparameter_importance.png`
   - `mlflow_reports/report.md`

4. **Use Saved Model**
   ```bash
   python 42_predict_vessel_trajectories.py
   ```

5. **Deploy to Maritime NLU**
   - Copy `results/xgboost_corrected_50_vessels/` to backend
   - Update backend integration
   - Restart API
