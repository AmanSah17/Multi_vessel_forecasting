## 📈 Performance Results

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric | LSTM | CNN | Difference | Winner |
|--------|------|-----|-----------|--------|
| MAE | 13.5556 | 14.0114 | -0.4558 | **LSTM** |
| RMSE | 37.2021 | 37.1635 | +0.0386 | CNN |
| R² | -0.5200 | -0.9551 | +0.4351 | **LSTM** |

### Key Findings

✅ **LSTM wins on 2/3 metrics**
- 3.3% lower MAE
- 45.6% higher R² (less negative)
- Slightly higher RMSE (marginal difference)

✅ **CNN advantages**
- 2x faster training (7 min vs 14 min)
- 18.8x fewer parameters (278 KB vs 5.24 MB)
- Better for resource-constrained environments

⚠️ **Both models show underfitting**
- Negative R² indicates poor generalization
- Models perform worse than baseline
- Need more features or model capacity

## 🔍 Analysis

### Why Underfitting?

1. **Limited Features** (17 total)
   - Missing domain-specific features
   - No vessel characteristics
   - No spatial context

2. **Short Sequences** (60 timesteps)
   - Only 1 hour of data
   - Insufficient temporal context
   - Limited pattern recognition

3. **Model Capacity**
   - LSTM: 256 units might be insufficient
   - CNN: Limited receptive field
   - Need deeper architectures

4. **Data Quality**
   - Possible preprocessing issues
   - Outliers not handled
   - Normalization problems

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Increase Features** (50+)
   - Add rolling statistics
   - Include interaction features
   - Add temporal patterns

2. **Increase Sequence Length**
   - 60 → 120 timesteps
   - Better temporal context
   - More pattern information

3. **Reduce Regularization**
   - Dropout: 0.2 → 0.1
   - Allow more learning
   - Longer training

### Advanced Improvements
1. **Model Enhancements**
   - Add attention mechanisms
   - Use residual connections
   - Implement ensemble methods

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
